      <p>League of Legends is an online Multiplayer Battle Arena (MOBA), in which 10 players are split into two teams and are pitted against each other in an effort to reach the other team's base first and destory their "nexus", which is the life-force for the team in question. This all takes place on a map called Summoners Rift, which is split in 3 lanes, Dragon, Middle, and Baron. Between these lanes exists a forest area called the Jungle which serves as the transportation between lanes. Along the way the teams have to take down at least 3 turrets which are heavily armored in order to get inside the enemy base and destroy the nexus. This whole concept sounds simple, but is complciated by the fact that the biggest obstacle in one's way is the enemy champion. Further, you are also insanely weak during the very beginning of the game, and so it is important to farm gold from defeating minions so you can obtain higher level items, which allow you to take on the enemy champions, and destroy their turrets much easier. Now with that information out of the way, I have compiled this website to tell you more about the different roles that you can play in League of Legends.</p>

      <p>The Support role in League of Legends is a very, if not the most important role in the game. The primary purpose for these players hinges on their ability to help the Attack Damage Carry (ADC) grow in power until eventually allowing the ADC to become the hypercarry that they are meant to be in the late game. However, the support not only deals with the ADC, even though that is their primary role. Supports are also famed for their game winning plays whether it be through the crowd contol of enemies, or the colossal 5-man ultimates that lead to a winning teamfight. Not only that, but they also serve as spys that go into the enemy jungle to seek out any wards that the enemy may have placed, in an effort to lower their vision around the map, giving their team the vision advantage by sabotaging the enemy. With all this in mind, its easy to see how the support role is integral to a team in League of Legends. </p>

      <p>Like the support role, the role of the Attack Damage Carry (ADC), named for its ability to carry the game off of its attack damage stats, is arguably the most important role in the game. There have been many games where teams go without an ADC in an effort to win the game with other champions, only to be demolished by the other team, due to the sheer amount of damage being done per second by the ADCs. And Sure, this is what they are most famed for. These champions attack <b><em>FAST</b></em>, and it is this damage taht essentially is the offense when you are playing the game. A good ADC is the difference between a lost game, and a game that can still be won. Unfortunately, the only con to this role is that due to their importance within the game, they are the target of assasins and even baron lane bruisers, since they have such little defenses due to their high damage output. As someone who is definitely biased, I believe that this role despite its downsides, is the most important role in the game. </p>

      <p>The role of the Jungler is quite an intricate one. Out of all of the roles mentioned in this webpage, this oen has to be the most complicated role, with all of the praise going to these players, or if things go south, all of the blame. Rightfully so, this role is of massive importance in keeping the game stabilized, as they play within the forrests of Summoners Rift, wandering from lane to lane, giving aid to any teammate that may need it. Not only that, but these players have to keep tabs on some of the most important objectives in the game itself: The Dragons, and the Rift Herald, both of which give whatever team slays them massive power-ups. In the case of the dragons, permanent power-ups. Equppied with smite, these players have to be ready to deal the killing blow at the exact right time, or risk losing the game for everyone involved. </p>

      <p>The role of the middle lane sure is a fun one when considering the game League of Legends. It is the role that every edgy teenager and every glory-oriented person gravitates towards due to the playstyles of the champions that call this lane home. In truth, this lane has the largest variety of playstyles when comparing all of the other roles. You have mages in here lumped in with fast-paced assasins, as well as some very slow-gameplay tanks such as Galio. The main role of the mid lane is to both win their respective lane, and also roam to both Baron and Dragon lane (where Supports and ADCs are), due to their convenient location on the map. These champions enjoy the luxury of not having the game depend on them when they lose their lane, but they also enjoy the benefit of having the game dictated by them and soley them when they manage to secure an enormous amount of power, something none of the other lanes have. </p>

      <p>
      <p>The Baron lane, sometimes dubbed the top lane, or the island, is the final role available in League of Legends. This lane is the home to people who love duels. Most of the champions that inhabit this lane are considered either bruisers/duelists, or tanks who can absorb massive amounts of damage (while still dealing a bunch of damage of course, what do you think we are, BALANCED??). Baron Lane is situated right next to both the Rift Herald, and also Baron Nashor, who spawns 20 minutes into the game. Baron is arguably the most powerful objective in the game, as defeating this monster grants the slaying team enormous damage powerups as well as a buff to their minions, which plow through the enemy turrets in seconds. This role does not have as much influence on the game as much as Dragon Lane and Jungle do, but they are still able to influence the outcome when they are needed, through the use of the teleport summoner spell, which transports them to help an ally within seconds.</p>
